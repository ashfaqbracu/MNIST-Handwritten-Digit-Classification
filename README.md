MNIST Handwritten Digit ClassificationÂ¶
This notebook looks into a neural network-based handwritten digit classification problem.

1. Problem Definiton
We are going to build a simple digit recognition and classification algorithm, using keras and simple neural network.

2. Data
The data used for this project is the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset first released in 1999.
It contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The dataset became a classical learning tool for computer vision and classification algorithms.

4. Tools
For this project, we are going to use Keras, a TensorFlow library that provides a Python interface for artificial neutal networks.
The basic data structures in Keras are layers and models. After building our model, we will use scikit-learn library to evaluate its peroformance.
